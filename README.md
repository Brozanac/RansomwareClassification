# Malware Detection Analysis and Modeling

## Description

This project involves analyzing a dataset for malware detection and evaluating various machine learning models to classify data as legitimate or malware. Key steps include dataset exploration, preprocessing, and applying classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.

## Features

- Analyze the dataset's structure, size, and quality
- Check for missing values and explore data distribution
- Implement machine learning models for classification
- Evaluate model performance with comprehensive metrics and visualizations

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following libraries are installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or a compatible environment:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "BitirmeProjesi_SON_ULAS_AKTAS.ipynb"
   ```
3. Run the cells sequentially to explore and analyze the data.

## Usage

- Replace the dataset in the notebook with your own by loading it in the appropriate section.
- Follow the preprocessing steps for data cleaning and exploration.
- Modify or tune the machine learning models as needed for your specific dataset.
- Use the evaluation metrics and visualizations to interpret model performance.
